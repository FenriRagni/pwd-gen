## Usage
The Password Generator can be used to generate a random password by choosing specific characteristics. <br>

If the user chooses a password length that is less than 8 or greater than 128, the generator displays a message informing them the password cannot be that length. If no value is chosen then it outputs you've no chosen no length <br>
